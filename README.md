Childhood obesity is a serious medical condition that affects children.It's particularly troubling because the extra 
pounds often start children on the path to health problems that were once considered adult problems â€” diabetes, high blood pressure and
high cholesterol. Childhood obesity can also lead to poor self-esteem and depression.

One of the best strategies to reduce childhood obesity is to improve the eating and exercise habits.
Treating and preventing childhood obesity helps protect a child's health now and in the future.

Therefore, the app created helps to do this.Children can now use this app to help them reduce weight and get fit. It is a app designed for all
types of children.
The project starts with a display/home screen, kids can navigate from this screen to the other screens available.
The first step to losing weight is exercising and this app has a list of effective exercises that can help children loose weight in no time(illustrated in the train
screen). Once a child clicks on a specific exercise a vibration will start for the duration of the time it takes to complete that specific exercise.They can stop 
a vibration in the middle.I made use for the vibration api here.
There is also a details screen allowing the user to enter their details such as their name,age,height,weigth.The users ibm can be calculated based on the info the user
has entered for their height and weigth.The users details can also be stored using the asyn storage .
The last screen provides a zumba exercise video for kids to do.This video has been taken from YouTube using the YouTube API.Link to the video is here :
